Bugs:
	Random crashing when resizing the screenshots vsplit (This is a Godot bug)
	Card Game: DE is bugged when launching through the launcher, fine otherwise 
Possible Updates:
	(?) Settings menu, for disabling discord RPC
	(?) Search Bar
		An option to only show certain games (functionality would be needed anyway)
